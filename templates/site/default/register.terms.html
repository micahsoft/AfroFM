<h2>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h2>

<p>

{$website_name} is a search engine that allows users to locate digital music files made freely available for streaming on Internet websites. If you are a registered user, the website will also allow you, in accordance with this Agreement, to perform various activities, including creating a profile for yourself, uploading photos, creating blog posts, submitting reviews of content, and communicating with other registered members. The website and any service made available via the website is referred to in this Agreement as the "Service." As of the date stated above, the Service is provided to you for free, but {$website_name} reserves the right to implement fees for any portion of the Service at any time.

</p>

<h2>3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</h2>

<p>

In consideration for your use of the Service, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving the Service under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or {$website_name} has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, {$website_name} has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).

</p>

<h2>4. YOUR OBLIGATIONS WHEN EMBEDDING A FLASH MUSIC PLAYER ON YOUR WEBSITE</h2>

<p>

The {$website_name} music player consists of web page code that calls to a copy of the Adobe Flash Player that is already installed on an end user's computer (the "Player"). You may embed the unmodified code for the Player on your website, your Myspace or other social networking site profile, or any other website. The Player must at all times display the following:

(a) The images and associated text under the Player, as {$website_name} may update from time to time. Currently these are "create a playlist", "download from iTunes", and "launch standalone player". The images and text come standard with the code for the Player provided by {$website_name};

(b) The song title and artist, if available, while streaming the music file using the Player. This is required because a primary goal of {$website_name} is to provide exposure for music artists and facilitate legal purchase of the artist's music while allowing fans to enjoy the music. This feature comes standard with the code for the Player provided by {$website_name}; and

(c) Any {$website_name} branding included with the Player.

If you modify the Player in any way, you may lose the ability to embed the Player without warning.

</p>

<h2>5. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY</h2>

<p>

You will receive a password and account designation upon completing the Service registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify {$website_name} of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. {$website_name|upper} WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING FROM YOUR FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY SAFEGUARD YOUR PASSWORD OR FOR ANY ACTIONS OCCURRING UNDER YOUR PASSWORD.

</p>

<h2>6. MEMBER CONDUCT AS TO COPYRIGHT POLICIES</h2>

<p>

a. Music Copyright Policy: {$website_name} is an information location tool intended to help you find and enjoy music that has been legally posted by others on the Internet for promotional or other legal purposes. It is {$website_name}'s policy to respect the legitimate interests of copyright owners. It is {$website_name}'s policy to remove links to any music file if an artist or other rights holder informs {$website_name} that the {$website_name} search engine is linking to an illegally posted song, in accordance with the law. It is also {$website_name}'s policy to terminate the accounts of users who we determine to be repeat infringers of other's copyrights.

b. User Compliance with Copyright Policy: As a user of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you will not violate the {$website_name} copyright policy by (i) adding links to the {$website_name} search index when you know that the links are to music files that have not been posted by the copyright owner for promotional or other legal purposes, (ii) uploading music files to a site and then adding the URL to the {$website_name} search index unless you are the owner of the copyright in the music, or (iii) representing that you are the owner of a copyright in a music file for the purpose of adding that file to the {$website_name} search index when you are not the owner. You also acknowledge and agree that {$website_name} may terminate your user account if it determines, in its sole discretion, that you are a repeat infringer of others' copyrights.

c. Other Copyrights: {$website_name} does allow members to post photos and designs to member profile web pages. Photos and designs are also subject to copyright protection. You acknowledge and agree that you will not post copyrighted material on your member web profile unless you have created that content yourself, or you have permission from the copyright owner to do so.

You hereby irrevocably waive (and agree to cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to your Content. The licenses granted to {$website_name} in this Agreement exist in perpetuity.

Monitoring of Content. You acknowledge that {$website_name} may or may not pre-screen Content, but that {$website_name} shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content that is available via the Service.

Alteration of Content. You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.

DRM. You understand that the Service and software embodied within the Service may include security components that permit digital materials to be protected, and that use of these materials is subject to usage rules set by {$website_name} and/or content providers who provide content to the Service. You may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage rules embedded into the Service or attempt to circumvent DRM in any files which you might find using the {$website_name} search engine.
